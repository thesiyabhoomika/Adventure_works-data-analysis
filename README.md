# Adventure_works-data-analysis
Overview 
The intended approach is 

This is an opportunity to learn. Just as important as the answer, is how we get there. Where possible we will try to use best practices.

We fit our solution to the problem. Not just to the data we’ve been given.

Rather than split responsibilities along vertical slices, we’ll split along horizontal lines. This is so that everyone gets to experience everything.

We use the best tool that fits the purpose.
